	abstract = {We present a full-scale simulation study of the generation of topside electrostatic turbulence observed near the F region peak during ground based ionospheric heating experiments. The study is performed using a generalized Zakharov model. The nonlinear tunneling of electromagnetic waves through the ionospheric layer is attributed to multiple-stage parametric decay and mode-conversion processes. At the bottomside of the F region, electrostatic turbulence excited by the parametric instability results in the conversion of the ordinary (O mode) wave into a large amplitude extraordinary (Z mode) wave propagating through the F peak. At the topside interaction region, the Z mode undergoes parametric decay process that results in the generation of the topside electrostatic turbulence and then conversion process yielding O waves that escape the plasma. This study may explain the observed topside ionospheric turbulence during ground based low duty cycle ionospheric heating experiments where the heater beam is directed far away from the Spitze region.},

The European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF radar was directed in magnetic zenith on October 18th and 19th, 2017 while stepping the pump frequency of the EISCAT Heating facility both upward and downward across the double resonance frequency of the fourth harmonic of the electron gyrofrequency and the local upper hybrid frequency, in a 2-min-on, 5-min-30-s-off pump cycle. We present observations of two separate cases of topside HF-enhanced ion lines (THFIL). THFIL simultaneous to bottomside HFIL (BHFIL), and conditioned by the relative proximity of the HF pump frequency to the bottomside double resonance frequency, consistent with previous observations (Rexer et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JA025822) were observed for HF pulses on 19th October. Recurring THFIL appearing after BHFIL have faded and conditioned by the relative proximity to the double resonance frequency on the topside ionosphere, were observed on 18th October. The THFIL are consistent with transionospheric propagation through artificial radio windows by L mode guiding of the pump wave, facilitated by large scale density ducts present in the plasma.},

The ionospheric electron density and temperature perturbations are examined by incorporating the ionospheric electron transport equations and ray-tracing algorithm. The energy distribution of oblique incidence heating waves in the ionosphere is calculated by the three-dimensional ray-tracing algorithm. The calculation takes into consideration the electric ﬁeld of heating waves in the caustic region by the plane wave spectral integral method. The simulation results show that the ionospheric electron density and temperature can be disturbed by oblique incidence of powerful radio waves, especially in the caustic region of heating waves. The oblique ionospheric heating with wave incidence parallel and perpendicular to the geomagnetic ﬁeld in the mid-latitude ionosphere is explored by simulations, results of which indicate that the ionospheric modulation is more effective when the heating wave propagates along the magnetic ﬁeld line. Ionospheric density and temperature striations in the caustic region due to thermal self-focusing instability are demonstrated, as well as the time evolution of the corresponding ﬂuctuation spectra.},

	abstract = {The fact that the incoherent backscatter spectrum narrows when the radar beam is nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field is well known and has been used at Jicamarca for more than 30 years to measure very accurate line-of-sight velocities. Recently it has become clear that these spectra are narrower than expected. We have explained this effect and also the small change to the spectral shape required at somewhat larger angles to correct the ratio of electron to ion temperature seen in some studies. Coulomb collisions affecting the motion of the electrons are responsible for the additional spectral narrowing. We have carried out very accurate simulations of electron motion resulting in incoherent scatter spectra which are qualitatively similar to spectra resulting from other types of collisions, and to those predicted in an analytic solution for the Coulomb case [Woodman, 1967]. However, we found that the spectrum of the velocity time series in the radar line of sight departs significantly from the nearly Lorentzian form expected with simple collisional models. This causes the collisional effects to extend to somewhat shorter scale lengths, or further from perpendicular to the magnetic field than expected. In order to investigate the collisional process more closely, we performed another simulation combining the effects of electron-ion collisions and a simple friction model (Langevin equation) in an adjustable combination. This one showed that the effect of electron-ion collisions alone would result in collisional effects extending several degrees farther from perpendicular to the field than when both kinds of collisions are included. Collisions affecting the speed of the electrons tend to limit the size of the effect at larger angles from perpendicular. Thus the effect of these collisions on the incoherent scatter spectrum cannot be accurately predicted from simple models but depends on the detailed physics of the collisions.},

The gyroline is associated with the dispersion relation for electrostatic whistler waves. Earlier treatments by Trulsen and Bjørna (1978, and references therein) derive the frequency and growth rate for these waves, but their derivation is only accurate for very small magnetic aspect angles, i.e., for wave vectors close to perpendicular to the geomagnetic field. Their expression for the frequency has the form of a low-order Padé approximate, but we find that a simple formula of this kind accurate for arbitrary magnetic aspect angles does not exist. We therefore analyze the incoherent scatter gyroline feature computationally. The analysis is supported by range-resolved incoherent scatter spectrograms measured recently at Arecibo. The gyroline feature is shown to be strongest in the midlatitude E and valley regions where the electron temperature is low enough to avoid cyclotron damping.},

	abstract = {Incoherent scatter radar observations of ionospheric plasmas rely on echoes from electron density fluctuations with properties governed by the dispersion relations for ion acoustic and Langmuir waves. Radar observations of echoes associated with Langmuir waves (plasma lines) from thermal plasma are weak, and only a few near-thermal level measurements have been reported. Plasma line echoes are typically only observed with existing radars only when the Langmuir waves are enhanced by suprathermal electrons. A new observation technique has been developed which is sensitive enough to allow observations of these echoes without the presence of suprathermal electrons up to at least 1000 km. This paper presents recent observations from the Arecibo Observatory 430 MHz incoherent scatter radar which show plasma line echoes during the night when no suprathermal enhancement is expected to be present. The observations are compared with theory, and the results are found to be in agreement with classical incoherent scatter theory for thermal plasmas. The theoretical ratio of the ion line and plasma line power spectral density is within approximately 3 dB of the predicted value. The finding adds a new observational capability, allowing electron density to also be observed at night using the plasma line well into the top side of the ionosphere, increasing the accuracy of the electron density measurement.},

	abstract = {The Millstone Hill incoherent scatter (IS) radar is used to measure spectra close to perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, and the data are fit to three different forward models to estimate ionospheric temperatures. IS spectra measured close to perpendicular to the magnetic field are heavily influenced by Coulomb collisions, and the temperature estimates are sensitive to the collision operator used in the forward model. The standard theoretical model for IS radar spectra treats Coulomb collisions as a velocity independent Brownian motion process. This gives estimates of Te/Ti {\textless} 1 when fitting the measured spectra for aspect angles up to 3.6°, which is a physically unrealistic result. The numerical forward model from Milla and Kudeki (2011, https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2057253) incorporates single-particle simulations of velocity-dependent Coulomb collisions into a linear framework, and when applied to the Millstone data, it predicts the same Te/Ti ratios as the Brownian theory. The new approach is a nonlinear particle-in-cell (PIC) code that includes velocity-dependent Coulomb collisions which produce significantly more collisional and nonlinear Landau damping of the measured ion-acoustic wave than the other forward models. When applied to the radar data, the increased damping in the PIC simulations will result in more physically realistic estimates of Te/Ti. This new approach has the greatest impact for the largest measured ionospheric densities and the lowest radar frequencies. The new approach should enable IS radars to obtain accurate measurements of plasma temperatures at times and locations where they currently cannot.},

Simultaneous ion line and plasma line measurements were taken by the Arecibo Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR). We used a novel experimental technique, enabling rapid pulsing of the heater, to collect ISR spectral data of the heated ionosphere without high frequency (HF)-induced enhanced ion line (HFIL), simplifying the analysis. ISR data were analyzed using Tikhonov regularization, revealing that the cavity was confined to a very narrow altitude range around 350 km and constituted a deep depletion of the electron density, along with strong electron temperature enhancement, and ion temperature enhancement.

The up- and downshifted ion line shoulders as well as the spectral region between them are enhanced equally and simultaneously. The power enhancements are one order of magnitude above the thermal level and are concentrated in less than 15 km wide altitude ranges at the ionospheric F region peak. The auroral arc passages are preceded by signiﬁcantly enhanced ion temperatures in the E region, assumed to be caused by transient electric ﬁelds associated with velocity shears. We use a Hall MHD model of velocity shears perpendicular to the geomagnetic ﬁeld and show that a Kelvin–Helmholtz instability will grow for the two presented cases.},

Because of the inherent simplicity of this approach, it is possible to extend the theory by including the effect of density fluctuations of the neutral molecules upon the scattering. The following results are obtained from the continuum theory: (1) The total predicted scattered power is exactly the same as in the previous kinetic theories. (2) The frequency spectrum of the scattered signal when neutral fluctuations are neglected agrees very well with the spectrum obtained using kinetic theory (with the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model for collisions) whenever λin, the ion-neutral mean free path, is smaller than λ0, the wave number of the incident signal. (3) The major difference in the spectrum when the neutral fluctuations are included is the addition of two resonances shifted from the signal frequency by ±kUn, where k=4πλ0, and Un is the neutral sound speed. For a weakly ionized gas, these resonances are found to be significant whenever λin{\textless}r12λ0, with r the ratio of the electron density to the neutral-atom density.},

	abstract = {A general expression for the frequency spectrum of radio waves scattered by the random thermal fluctuations of electron density in a plasma in a magnetic field is derived. The derivation is based on the generalized Nyquist noise theorem used in part I. The exact result is then; simplified by means of an approximation which amounts to assuming the velocity of light to be infinite. It is shown that this approximation is quite adequate for ionospheric applications of the theory. Next it is proved, without appealing to any approximation, that the magnetic held can never alter the total scattered signal power; it can only redistribute this power over the spectrum. Finally, the detailed shape of the frequency spectrum of the scattered signal is examined. Analytic expressions are given for certain limiting cases, but for the cases of most interest, numerical methods must be used. The results of some numerical calculations are shown in figures 1 and 2. From these results, it can be seen that the magnetic field has a significant effect on the shape of the spectrum only if the incident radio beam is very nearly orthogonal to the magnetic lines of force. For example, for an operating frequency of 40 Mc/s, no significant magnetic effect is observed even when the beam is within 5 of orthogonality. As this angle is decreased further, however, the spectrum rapidly begins to develop spikes at Doppler shifts which are approximate multiples of the ion gyro-frequency. These spikes are quite pronounced when the beam is 2° from orthogonality. At higher operating frequencies, the beam must be proportionally closer to orthogonality to achieve the same effect.},

The theoretical discussions include a brief description of the electrostatic dispersion relation, excitation of Langmuir waves by electron beams, and the stability of beam distributions. The theory of Langmuir turbulence—including the parametric decay instability and wave collapse—is also brieﬂy discussed. The main focus of the review, however, is on the observations of Langmuir waves and turbulence in the ionosphere by in-situ and ground-based sensors. A summary of ﬁve decades of in-situ wave and particle observations is presented and combined with a collection of more recent results from ground-based instruments. The ground-based observations include signatures of Langmuir turbulence in the form of coherent echoes in incoherent scatter radar measurements; signatures of electron beams in the form of auroral morphologies recorded by high-speed, high-resolution optical imagers; and electromagnetic emissions received on the ground at high latitudes. Uniting the various observations obtained by the vastly different sensors is shown to provide further insight into the micro-scale processes that occur in the ionosphere. Also discussed in this review is the potential of the ground-based sensors to provide a broader spatial and temporal context for single-point in-situ measurements of such processes.},

This intensity depends on the velocity distribution through plasma wave-particle interactions such as Landau damping. The measurements were carried out at the Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory (L ≈ 1.5, geographic latitude 18°N). The experimental values for the vertically upward flux of photoelectrons are in the range (3–10) × 108 cm−2 sec−1, and, for the upward energy flux, (3–13) × 109 ev cm−2 sec−1. The experiments show that the daytime downward flux is equal to the upward flux to within experimental error (±50\%) at Arecibo. Some December 1966 observations during the presunrise and postsunset periods have detected photoelectrons originating at the magnetic conjugate point. The effect of a weak (ωp {\textgreater} ωc) magnetic field on the Landau damping of plasma waves by a Maxwellian velocity distribution was investigated by changing the angle θ between the radar beam and the magnetic field. The theoretical prediction that the Landau damping is orders of magnitude larger than the field-free case and depends strongly on angle was verified experimentally.},

In the F region, photoelectrons produced by solar EUV line emissions (He II and Mg IX) give rise to plasma line spectral peaks/valleys. These and other structures occur within an enhancement zone extending from electron phase energies of 14–27 eV in both the bottomside and topside ionosphere. However, photoelectron–thermal electron Coulomb energy losses can lead to a broadened spectral structure with no resolved peaks in the topside ionosphere. The plasma line energy spectra obtained in the enhancement zone exhibit a unique relation in that phase energy is dependent on pitch angle; this relation does not exist in any other part of the energy spectrum. Moreover, large fluctuations in the difference frequency between the upshifted and downshifted plasma lines are evident in the 14–27 eV energy interval. At high phase energies near 51 eV the absolute intensities of photoelectron-excited Langmuir waves are much larger than those predicted by existing theory. The new measurements call for a revision/improvement of plasma line theory in several key areas.},

This paper uses large-scale kinetic simulations to show that photoelectrons can drive electron waves, which then enhance ion density irregularities that radars could observe as 150 km echoes. This model explains why 150 km echoes exist only during the day and why they appear at their lowest altitudes near noon. It predicts the spectral structure observed by Chau (2004) and suggests observations that can further evaluate this mechanism. It also shows the types and strength of electron modes that photoelectron-wave interactions generate in a magnetized plasma.},

The analysis performed in this work shows that such a beam-driven wave may be simultaneously detected with NEIALs within the baseband signal of a single ISR. The analysis shows that simultaneous detection of NEIALs and the first Langmuir harmonic is more likely than simultaneous detection of NEIALs and enhanced plasma line.

Results from one-dimensional Zakharov simulations are used to study the interaction of ionospheric electron beams with the background plasma at the F region peak. A broad range of beam parameters extending by more than 2 orders of magnitude in average energy and electron number density is considered. A range of wave interaction processes, from a single parametric decay, to a cascade of parametric decays, to formation of stationary density cavities in the condensate region, and to direct collapse at the initial stages of turbulence, is observed as we increase the input energy to the system. The effect of suprathermal electrons, produced by collisional interactions of auroral electrons with the neutral atmosphere, on the dynamics of Langmuir turbulence is also investigated. It is seen that the enhanced Landau damping introduced by the suprathermal electrons significantly weakens the turbulence and truncates the cascade of parametric decays.},

	abstract = {An important property associated with turbulence in plasmas and fluids is anomalous transport. Plasma, being a good conductor, can in addition be affected by turbulence causing an anomalous resistivity that can significantly exceed its classical counterpart. While turbulent transport may be adequately described in configuration space, some aspects of the anomalous resistivity are best accounted for in phase space. Kinetic phenomena like electron and ion phase space vortices can thus act as obstacles for the free flow of slow charged particles. Plasma instabilities and large amplitude plasma waves are candidates for contributions to the anomalous resistivity by generating such structures. Langmuir waves can be relevant, but also others, such as upper- as well as lower-hybrid waves in magnetized plasmas. Often these anomalous resistivity effects can be small, but due to the large spatial and temporal scales involved in space plasmas, planetary ionosphere and magnetosphere in particular, even such moderate effects can be important. This mini-review is discussing elements of the description of plasma turbulence with particular attention to wave phenomena that contribute to anomalous resistivity and diffusion. Turbulence effects can have relevance for space weather phenomena as well, where ground based and airborne activities relying on for instance Global Positioning and Global Navigation Satellite Systems are influenced by plasma conditions in geospace.},

First, an overview of the basic physics of linear waves and nonlinear wave-wave interactions is given from an introductory perspective. Wave-wave processes are then considered in more detail. Next, an introductory overview of the physics of wave collapse and strong turbulence is provided, followed by a more detailed theoretical treatment. Later sections cover numerical simulations of Langmuir collapse and strong turbulence and experimental applications to space, ionospheric, and laboratory plasmas, including laser-plasma and beam-plasma interactions. Generalizations to self-focusing, collapse, and strong turbulence of waves in other systems are also discussed, including nonlinear optics, solid-state systems, magnetized auroral and astrophysical plasmas, and deep-water waves.

	abstract = {A general stability analysis is performed for the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in sheared magnetohydrodynamic flow of finite thickness in a compressible plasma. The analysis allows for arbitrary orientation of the magnetic field B0, velocity flow v0, and wave vector k in the plane perpendicular to the velocity gradient, and no restrictions are imposed on the sound or Alfvén Mach numbers. The stability problem is reduced to the solution of a single second-order differential equation, which includes a gravitational term to represent coupling between the Kelvin-Helmholtz mode and the interchange mode. In the incompressible limit it is shown that the Kelvin-Helmholtz mode is completely stabilized for any velocity profile as long as the condition is satisfied, where V0 is the total velocity jump across the shear layer. Numerical results are obtained for a hyperbolic tangent velocity profile for the transverse (B0 ⊥ v0) and parallel (B0∥v0) flow configurations. Only modes with kΔ {\textless} 2 are unstable, where Δ is the scale length of the shear layer. The fastest growing modes occur for kΔ ∼ 0.5-1.0. Compressibility and a magnetic field component parallel to the flow are found to be stabilizing effects. For the transverse case, only the fast magnetosonic mode is destabilized, but if k · B0 ≠ 0, the instability contains Alfvén-mode and slow-mode components as well. The Alfvén component gives rise to a field-aligned current inside the shear layer. In the parallel case, both Alfvén and slow magnetosonic components are present, with the Alfvén mode confined inside the shear layer. The results of the analysis are used to discuss the stability of sheared plasma flow at the magnetopause boundary and in the solar wind. At the magnetopause boundary, the fastest growing Kelvin-Helmholtz mode has a frequency of 0 (V0/2Δ), which overlaps with the frequency range of geomagnetic pulsations (Pc 3-5). It is suggested that the MHD Kelvin-Helmholtz instability could serve as a dynamo process driving small-scale field-aligned currents in the presence of the sheared plasma flow in the magnetosphere.},

The electron phase space vortices were excited in a strongly magnetized Q-machine plasma by applying a pulse to a segment of a waveguide surrounding the plasma. Depending on the temporal variation of the applied pulse, one or more phase space vortices can be excited, and their interaction can be followed in space and time. We were able to demonstrate, for instance, an irreversible coalescence of two such vortices. These results are extended by numerical simulations, showing how electron phase space vortices can also be formed by beam instabilities. Furthermore, a study of ion phase space vortices is performed by numerical simulations. Both codes allow for an externally applied magnetic field in three spatial dimensions. Ion phase space vortices are formed by the nonlinear saturation of the ion-ion two-stream instability, excited by injecting an ion beam at the plasma boundary. By following the evolution of the ion distribution of the velocity perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the injected ion beam, we find a significant ion heating in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field associated with the ion phase space vortices being formed. The results are relevant, for instance, for the interpretation of observations by instrumented spacecraft in the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive review of recent theoretical and numerical studies of the formation and dynamics of electron and ion holes in a collisionless plasma. The electron hole is characterized by a localized positive potential in which a population of electrons is trapped, and a depletion of the electron number density, while the ion hole is associated with localized negative potential in which a population of ions is trapped and a depletion of both the ion and electron densities occur. We present conditions for the existence of quasi-stationary electron and ion holes in unmagnetized and magnetized electron–ion plasmas, as well as in an unmagnetized pair-ion plasma. An interesting aspect is the dynamic interactions between ion and electron holes and the surrounding plasma. The dynamics is investigated by means of numerical simulations in which analytical solutions of quasi-stationary electron and ion holes are used as initial conditions. Our Vlasov simulations of two colliding ion holes reveal the acceleration of electrons and a modification of the initially Maxwellian electron distribution function by the ion hole potentials, which work as barriers for the electrons. A secondary effect is the excitation of high-frequency plasma waves by the streams of electrons. On the other hand, we find that electron holes show an interesting dynamics in the presence of mobile ions. Since electron holes are associated with a positive electrostatic potential, they repel positively charged ions. Numerical simulations of electron holes in a plasma with mobile ions exhibit that the electron holes are, in general, attracted by ion density maxima and repelled by ion density minima. Therefore, standing electron holes can be accelerated by the self-created ion cavities. In a pair plasma, both the temperatures and masses of the positively and negatively charged particles are assumed equal, and therefore one must treat both species with a kinetic theory on an equal footing. Accordingly, a phase-space hole in one of the species is associated with reflected particles in the opposite species. Here standing solitary large-amplitude holes are not allowed, but they must have a propagation speed close to the thermal speed of the particles. We discuss extensions of the existing non-relativistic theories for the electron and ion holes in two directions. First, we describe a fully nonlinear kinetic theory for relativistic electron holes (REHs) in an unmagnetized plasma, and show that the REHs have amplitudes and widths much larger than their non-relativistic counterparts. Second, we extend the weakly nonlinear theories for the electron and ion holes to include the effects of the external magnetic field and the plasma inhomogeneity. The presence of the external magnetic field gives rise to the electron and ion hole structures which have differential scale sizes along and across the magnetic field direction. Consideration of the density inhomogeneity in a magnetized plasma with non-isothermal electron distribution function provides the possibility of bipolar electrostatic pulses that move with the electron diamagnetic drift across the density inhomogeneity and the magnetic field directions. In a plasma with sheared magnetic field we can have fast reconnection involving phase-space vortices in the lower-hybrid frequency range. We further present theoretical and numerical investigations of the nonlinear interaction between ion and electron holes and large amplitude high-frequency electrostatic and electromagnetic waves in plasmas. Since the ion hole is associated with a depletion of both the electron and ion densities, it can work as a resonance cavity for trapped Langmuir waves whose frequencies are below the electron plasma frequency of the unperturbed plasma. Large-amplitude Langmuir waves can modify the ion hole due to the ponderomotive force which pushes the electrons away from the center of the hole. This process can be modeled by a coupled nonlinear Schrödinger and Poisson system of equations, which exhibit a discrete set of trapped Langmuir eigenmodes in the ion hole in plasmas without and with high-Z charged impurities. In a kinetic description, however, the trapped Langmuir waves are Landau damped due to the relatively small length scale of the ion hole. Intense electromagnetic waves (IEMWs) can also be trapped by the REHs in an unmagnetized plasma. We study the localization of arbitrary large amplitudes IEMWs by incorporating nonlinearities associated with relativistic electron mass increase, relativistic ponderomotive force of the IEMWs, and non-isothermal electron distributions. We find that the combined effects of these three nonlinearities produce extremely large amplitude REHs which traps localized IEMWs. Such a nonlinear structure can accelerate electrons to very high energies. The relevance of our investigation to numerous localized structures observed in laboratory and space plasmas is discussed. We also propose to conduct new experiments that can confirm our new theoretical and simulation models dealing with kinetic nonlinear structures in electron–ion and electron–positron plasmas. Finally, we present our views of possible extensions of theoretical models and computer simulations that have been reviewed in here.},

300km
. The nonlinear coupling between Langmuir waves and ion-acoustic waves is governed by the Zakharov system of equations. The model is enhanced with stochastic forcing in order to estimate by how much over the thermal level the spectrum seen by an incoherent scatter radar will be enhanced. This also allows us to directly compare the modeled spectra to the observed spectra collected by the incoherent scattering technique, as well as to statistically investigate the signature of the modeled spectra through an exploratory data analysis. Results for different beam energies are presented, covering the regimes of weak as well as strong turbulence. The incoherent scatter spectra signature is discussed in light of these regimes. It is shown that incoherent scatter radar observations of enhanced ion-acoustic and/or Langmuir waves compared to thermal level can provide good estimates of the beam parameters and of the type of turbulent regime. The cascade regime leads to strongly asymmetric spectra with enhancements over a limited range of wave numbers. The cavitation regime leads to marginally asymmetric spectra, with enhancement over a wide range of wave numbers, and features a central peak for a limited range of wave numbers. Finally, it is shown that the Langmuir turbulence should be preferentially observed for scattering wavelengths large compared to the Debye length.},

	abstract = {All the bodies of the solar system are embedded in the supersonic flux of energetic particles emitted by the Sun. Since the advent of the space age, the models to describe the interaction of this plasma flow with the planets, asteroids, comets etc. have drastically progressed. The possibilities of in situ measurements of the particle distributions and electromagnetic fields have enabled the plasma theories to be tested under astrophysical conditions. Energy transfer from the Sun to the outermost regions of the heliosphere as well as the processes leading to the dissipation of this energy are central questions for heliophysicists. Understanding the dynamics of the particles is thus critical. It is a particularly complicated subject since the medium is (almost) non-collisional. Thus, next to the description of the particles, the development of waves must be considered. Indeed, they participate to the exchange of energy between different species that would not interact otherwise. In other words, waves may play the role of collisions. This paper concentrates on Langmuir waves for their strong links with the electron dynamics. The basic processes of growth and saturation of the Langmuir waves are reviewed to stress their diagnostic capabilities. Then, the characteristics of the waves are described in the several heliophysical contexts: the planetary environments (in particular the ionosphere, the magnetotail and the foreshock) and in the interplanetary medium (in quiescent conditions of the solar wind or during transient events). A particular emphasis is given to results obtained in the last 15 years.},

The radio wave propagates from the neutral atmosphere into the ionospheric plasma layer and reaches the turning points of the ordinary and extraordinary wave modes. At the turning point of the ordinary mode, a parametric instability takes place in which the electromagnetic wave decays into an electron plasma wave and an ion acoustic wave with a typical wavelength of one meter. This is followed by collapse and caviton formation and trapping of the intense electron plasma wave. The cavitons lead to an efficient excitation of slow X (or Z) waves that propagate further into the denser ionospheric layer at higher altitudes. We use a realistic ion (oxygen) mass, length scales, and other plasma parameters. This numerical study should be useful for understanding the nonlinear interaction between intense radio waves and the ionosphere.},

It is shown that a widely accepted interpretation of these cavities as collapsing lower hybrid wave packets localized in self-consistent density wells produced by their ponderomotive force is only partly consistent with observations. Observed potentials match or exceed those required for collapse and most observed length scales and aspect ratios lie in the theoretically predicted range. However, associated density perturbations appear to be almost always negative, contrary to theory based on ponderomotive force balance, which predicts them to be positive and negative equally often; moreover, they are typically 100 times greater in magnitude than this theory predicts. It is concluded that the electric-field and length-scale data are consistent with the occurrence of lower hybrid collapse, but that the lower hybrid waves either accumulate in preexisting density depressions, or produce the depressions ponderomotively via multiple collapses at a single site, or by means other than their ponderomotive force, as suggested by some previous authors. This work also suggests a possible resolution of conflicting results relating to the dominance of electron or ion heating by collapsing lower hybrid wave packets, with electron heating dominating for large ratios of electron temperature to ion temperature and ion heating prevailing in the opposite limit.},

	abstract = {Auroral medium frequency (MF) bursts are broadband, impulsive radio emissions associated with local substorm onsets. MF bursts consist of a characteristic fine structure whereby the higher frequencies arrive 10–100 ms before the lower frequencies. LaBelle (2011a) proposed that MF bursts originate as Langmuir/Z mode waves on the topside of the ionosphere that mode-convert to LO mode waves and propagate to ground level, with the fine structure resulting by propagation delays due to the topside ionospheric density profile. We investigate three aspects of this mechanism. First, full-wave calculations are used to simulate the MF burst fine structure using a realistic ionospheric density profile. The delay between the highest and lowest frequencies is 21 ms. This value is smaller than the experimentally determined delays of ∼100 ms presented in Bunch and LaBelle (2009), but differences between the topside electron number density profile used in the simulations and the number density profile during disturbed conditions make comparisons only approximate. Second, the Landau damping of Langmuir/Z mode waves on the topside ionosphere is calculated, assuming the electron distribution function consists of a cold background population (ne0) and a warm secondary population (nse). The Landau damping is small when nse/ne0 = 0.04\% (consistent with Maggs and Lotko (1981)) but is significant when nse/ne0 {\textgreater} 0.4\%. Finally, full-wave calculations are used to determine the mode conversion efficiency from Langmuir/Z mode waves to LO mode waves. These imply that waves would suffer an attenuation of wave energy density of approximately 5–10\% if they are generated with their wave vectors in a narrow cone centered around the local magnetic field. Taken together, these calculations suggest that for small values of nse/ne0 {\textless}0.4\%, the mechanism proposed by LaBelle (2011a) is a plausible explanation for the origin of MF bursts.},

	abstract = {We present here a systematic simulational study on electron beam driven waves and their consequences in terms of plasma electrodynamics. The study is performed by using three-dimensional particle-in-cell code, parallelized to simulate a large volume of plasma. Our simulation shows that an initial electron beam of finite radius with beam velocity along the ambient magnetic field triggers a series of events in the evolution of the waves and the plasma. In the initial stage (t ≤ 200 ωpo−1, ωpo being the electron plasma frequency with the total electron density n0), high frequency waves near ω ∼ ωpo are driven. These waves progressively disappear giving way to the dominance of lower hybrid (LH) waves. The phase of the lower hybrid waves lasts over the time interval . In this time period the LH waves stochastically accelerate ions transverse to B0, and the beam electrons are scattered outside the initial beam volume to occupy the entire volume of the simulation plasma. The ion acceleration leads to the formation of elongated tail in the perpendicular velocity distribution. The large-amplitude LH waves are seen to undergo a parametric decay into resonance cone waves at frequencies ω {\textless} Ωi, the ion cyclotron frequency. Such extremely low-frequency (ELF) waves are the electrostatic version of the inertial Alfven waves. The phase of the strong LH waves is followed by a stage in which HF waves with frequencies ω ∼ ωpo appear again, but in this stage they are strongly modulated by the already present ELF waves and other low-frequency waves in the frequency range near the ion cyclotron frequency Ωi and its harmonics. Beginning with the LH wave stage and continuing into the late stages of ELF waves, the plasma density is highly filamented and the filaments oscillate with the ELF frequencies. The relevance of our results to the observations on plasma waves from satellites is brought out.},

	abstract = {A conventional model for the generation of Langmuir waves in Type-III radio bursts is based on a one-dimensional (1D) version of the quasilinear equations. In this model a wave with phase velocity \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}phi \}\$resonates with an electron with velocity \$v=v\_\{{\textbackslash}phi \}\$, causing the waves to grow at a rate \${\textbackslash}propto \{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{d\}\}F(v)/\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{d\}\}v{\textgreater}0\$, where \$F(v)\$is the 1D-distribution function. The backreaction on the electrons drives the electrons towards a plateau distribution: \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{d\}F(v)/\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{d\}\}v{\textbackslash}to 0\$. In the 3D-generalization, none of these features apply: waves with phase speed \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}phi \}\$can resonate with electrons with speed \$v{\textless} v\_\{{\textbackslash}phi \}\$, depending on the angle between the wave normal and the electron velocity, wave growth occurs only if the distribution function is both an increasing function of \$v\$and also has an anisotropic pitch-angle distribution, and the backreaction involves diffusion in both speed \$v\$and in pitch-angle \${\textbackslash}alpha \$. In this article we discuss implications of the generalization from 1D to 3D on models for Type-III bursts. An effect that is absent in 1D, but may be important in 3D, is scattering of Langmuir waves by turbulence in the ambient plasma. Pitch-angle scattering by the scattered Langmuir waves may play an important role in the evolution of the Type-III beam.},

This calculation is done within the frame of the weak turbulence approximation. We study the spectral signature of such a process as seen by a VHF incoherent scatter radar. An incoherent scatter (IS) spectrum is characterized by two maxima at k\textit{$_{\textrm{radar}}$} and -k\textit{$_{\textrm{radar}}$}, the right and left ion lines respectively. It is shown that, for reasonable beam parameters, the parametric decay of beam-generated Langmuir waves can enhance either the right, the left or both ion lines simultaneously. The shape of the spectrum can change drastically on time scale of about 0.1 to 1 s. The role of the beam parameter as well as the ionospheric parameters is also investigated. For a given beam number density, the beam energy or the background density are important to trigger either the left or the right ion line. A large energy spread of the beam or low electron collision frequencies can explain the simultaneous observations of the left and the right ion line. The importance of the electron collision frequency can explain the altitude distribution of the coherent echoes observed by incoherent scatter radars.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}\textbf{Key words.} Ionosphere (plasma waves and instabilities) · Space plasma physics (waves and instabilities; wave-wave interactions){\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A plasma is a partially or fully ionized gas where ionization and recombination are balanced to keep the ionized gas to be charge neutral as a whole. Once the charge neutrality is broken, a large electric field is locally created to drive the plasma unstable. In this sense, the charge neutrality (rigorously quasi-charge neutrality) is essentially important. This implies that the potential in the plasma is usually determined through not Poisson’s equation but equations of motion for the electrons and ions under the charge neutrality.},

For the first time, long sequences of NEIALs are recorded, with more than 50 events within an hour, ranging from 6.4 to 140 s in duration. The events took place from {\textasciitilde}08:45 to 10:00 UT, 22 January 2004. We combine ESR data with observations of optical aurora by a meridian scanning photometer at wavelengths 557.7, 630.0, 427.8, and 844.6 nm, as well as records from a magnetometer and an imaging riometer. The large numbers of observed NEIALs together with these additional observations, enable us to characterise the particle precipitation during the NEIAL events. We find that the intensities in all optical lines studied must be above a certain level for the NEIALs to appear. We also find that the soft particle precipitation is associated with the down-shifted shoulder in the incoherent scatter spectrum, and that harder precipitation may play a role in the enhancement of the up-shifted shoulder. The minimum energy flux during NEIAL events found in this study was {\textasciitilde}3.5 mW/m2 and minimum characteristic energy around 50 eV.},

	abstract = {A reduced-parameter (RP) model of quasilinear wave-plasma interactions is used to analyze statistical properties of beam-driven waves in plasmas with ambient density fluctuations. The probability distribution of wave energies in such a system is shown to have a relatively narrow peak just above the thermal wave level, and a power-law tail at high energies, the latter becoming progressively more evident for increasing characteristic amplitude of the ambient fluctuations. To better understand the physics behind these statistical features of the waves, a simplified model of stochastically driven thermal waves is developed on the basis of the RP model. An approximate analytic solution for stationary statistical distribution of wave energies 
𝑊
W
 is constructed, showing a good agreement with that of the original RP model. The “peak” and “tail” features of the wave energy distribution are shown to be a result of contributions of two groups of wave clumps: those subject to either very slow or very fast random variations of total wave growth rate (due to fluctuations of ambient plasma density), respectively. In the case of significant ambient plasma fluctuations, the overall wave energy distribution is shown to have a clear power-law tail at high energies, 
𝑃(𝑊)∝
𝑊
−𝛼
P(W)∝W−α
, with nontrivial exponent 
1{\textless}𝛼{\textless}2
1{\textless}α{\textless}2
, while for weak fluctuations it is close to the lognormal distribution predicted by pure stochastic growth theory. The model’s wave statistics resemble the statistics of plasma waves observed by the Ulysses spacecraft in some interplanetary type III burst sources. This resemblance is discussed qualitatively, and it is suggested that the stochastically driven thermal waves might be a candidate for explaining the power-law tails in the observed wave statistics without invoking mechanisms such as self-organized criticality or nonlinear wave collapse.},

A powerful radar can detect the incoherent backscatter from the free electrons in and above the earth's ionosphere.

On the basis of incoherent backscatter by free electrons a powerful radar, but one whose components are presently within the state of the art, is capable of: 1) measuring electron density and electron temperature as a function of height and time at all levels in the earth's ionosphere and to heights of one or more earth's radii; 2) measuring auroral ionization; 3) detecting transient streams of charged particles coming from outer space; and 4) exploring the existence of a ring current. The instrument is capable of 1) obtaining radar echoes from the sun, Venus, and Mars and possibly from Jupiter and Mercury; and 2) receiving from certain parts of remote space hitherto-undetected sources of radiation at meter wavelengths.},

	abstract = {During geomagnetically active periods, the 440-MHz steerable Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar system often receives powerful coherent radar echoes when observing the lower ionosphere in regions roughly to the north of the antenna, and for distances ranging between 700 and 1000 km. With the exception of a few anomalous events, the echoes clearly originate from the E region, and the aspect angle of the irregularities responsible for the coherent echoes is within one half degree of perpendicularity to the magnetic field. The strength of these coherent E region echoes increases with the inferred electric field strength. In contrast with similar experiments reported earlier with the Homer system, the Doppler shift of the coherent spectrum that we observe seems to correspond to the line of sight component of the plasma drift unless this component exceeds the ion acoustic speed. In the latter case, the Doppler shift then appears to be limited to the ion acoustic speed as it does with other coherent radar systems. The mean height of the scattering layer varies between 105 and 115 km for any single event, while there is some evidence to suggest that the vertical width of the scattering volume may be as small as 4 to 5 km at times. We saw evidence for an occasional layering of the E region scattering into two distinct regions. As a result of the present study, we plan to exploit the unique sensitivity of the Millstone Hill radar to make direct simultaneous comparisons between mean F region plasma drifts and the Doppler shift of E region irregularities.},

Comparison with earlier results is given. Furthermore, numerical results obtained by a direct simulation method in two dimensions are also presented. In a linear regime, detailed agreement with the results of the corresponding eigenvalue problem is found. In the nonlinear regime of the soliton instability all considered cases exhibit a collapse dynamics. Moreover, in the developed, highly nonlinear stage of the soliton collapse, self-similar behavior consistent with a ‘‘weak’’ collapse regime is found.},

	abstract = {Results are presented for an extensive study of strong Langmuir turbulence (SLT) in plasmas excited near the critical density by intense coherent radiation beams. The nominal parameters for HF heating experiments imply that the ionospheric plasma is in such a state. A large body of experimental data exists, particularly from incoherent scatter radar (ISR) measurements of HF-enhanced fluctuation levels. Long-time simulations of Zakharov's model of SLT and related theoretical arguments have led to new conclusions and insights: (1) linear parametric instabilities may play a role only during the first few milliseconds after heater turn-on in a quiescent ionosphere, but there is also the possibility of “direct nucleation” of cavitons in preexisting density fluctuations; (2) both possibilities lead to Langmuir collapse; (3) the turbulence is sustained by nucleation of trapped electric fields in burnt-out density cavities from previous collapses; (4) the nucleation-collapse-burnout scenario explains several features of the observed ISR plasma line power spectra in early-time, low-duty cycle experiments and predicts new features; (5) ISR spectra obtained at early times in low-duty cycle heating experiments are consistent with the spectra of uncorrelated caviton events; (6) these spectra contain a “free mode” peak which is due to the radiation of free Langmuir waves by collapsing cavitons; this peak has recently been observed; (7) sharp spectral peaks observed in strong spectra in longer-time, high-duty cycle or CW heating can arise in the SLT model from spatio-temporal caviton correlations, provided overdense domains exist and a Bragg resonance condition is satisfied; (8) correlation models can explain all the sharp features including the decay line, the cascade, the narrow oscillating two-stream instability line, and the anti-Stokes line; these models do not involve parametric instabilities; (9) the characteristic structure of the ISR spectrum is maintained over a much wider range of angles relative to the geomagnetic field than is the case for weak turbulence predictions; (10) the altitude dependence of the plasma line is consistent with observation without postulating large-scale density modifications; and (11) the nonlinear absorption rate of heater energy is much larger than collisional absorption, the absorbed energy going mainly into suprathermal electrons.},

	abstract = {Abstract. In an incoherent scattering radar experiment, the spectral measurement of the so-called up- and downshifted electron plasma lines provides information about their intensity and their Doppler frequency. These two spectral lines correspond, in the backscatter geometry, to two Langmuir waves travelling towards and away from the radar. In the daytime ionosphere, the presence of a small percentage of photoelectrons produced by the solar EUV of the total electron population can excite or damp these Langmuir waves above the thermal equilibrium, resulting in an enhancement of the intensity of the lines above the thermal level. The presence of photo-electrons also modifies the dielectric response function of the plasma from the Maxwellian and thus influences the Doppler frequency of the plasma lines. In this paper, we present a high time-resolution plasma-line data set collected on the Eiscat VHF radar. The analysed data are compared with a model that includes the effect of a suprathermal electron population calculated by a transport code. By comparing the intensity of the analysed plasma lines data to our model, we show that two sharp peaks in the electron suprathermal distribution in the energy range 20-30 eV causes an increased Landau damping around 24.25 eV and 26.25 eV. We have identified these two sharp peaks as the effect of the photoionisation of N2 and O by the intense flux of monochromatic HeII radiation of wavelength 30.378 nm (40.812 eV) created in the chromospheric network and coronal holes. Furthermore, we see that what would have been interpreted as a mean Doppler drift velocity for a Maxwellian plasma is actually a shift of the Doppler frequency of the plasma lines due to suprathermal electrons.Key words.

The difference contains an additional strong nonlinear dependence on the electron temperature. We show here that the origin of this shift in the center frequency between the upshifted and downshifted lines can easily be due to heat flows in the electron gas. We present a new expression for the dispersion relation that includes the heat flow contribution, and we use a recently acquired data set to demonstrate that the heat flow correction produces the right kind of results. For radar frequencies around 1000 MHz and plasma frequencies of the order of 7 MHz, this means that an electron temperature gradient of the order of 1 K/km can produce a difference approaching 500 Hz between the upshifted and downshifted frequencies. This shift in frequency is important, as it is comparable to the shift caused by parallel currents of a few microamperes per square meter.},

The electron velocity distribution is separated into two distributions representing the distribution of the ambient electrons and the suprathermal electrons. The velocity distribution function of the ambient electrons is modelled by a near-Maxwellian distribution function in presence of a temperature gradient and a potential electric field. The velocity distribution function of the suprathermal electrons is derived from a numerical model of the angular energy flux spectrum obtained by solving the transport equation of electrons. The numerical method used to calculate the plasma dispersion function and the reduced velocity distribution is described. The numerical code is used with simulated data to evaluate the Doppler frequency asymmetry between the up- and downshifted plasma lines of the incoherent-scatter plasma lines at different wave vectors. It is shown that the observed Doppler asymmetry is more dependent on deviation from the Maxwellian through the thermal part for high-frequency radars, while for low-frequency radars the Doppler asymmetry depends more on the presence of a suprathermal population. It is also seen that the full evaluation of the plasma dispersion function gives larger Doppler asymmetry than the heat flow approximation for Langmuir waves with phase velocity about three to six times the mean thermal velocity. For such waves the moment expansion of the dispersion function is not fully valid and the full calculation of the dispersion function is needed.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}\textbf{Key words.} Non-Maxwellian electron velocity distribution · Incoherent scatter plasma lines · EISCAT · Dielectric response function{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A new approach to the calculation of the dispersion integrals involved in determining the dielectric properties of arbitrary plasmas is developed. Rather than relying on ad hoc approximation methods, the dispersion integrals for an arbitrary distribution function with continuous derivative are systematically expanded in terms of a set of orthogonal functions for which the corresponding dispersion functions are known. Realizations of this general approach are discussed for unmagnetized plasmas and generalizations to treat relativistic and magnetized plasmas are also outlined. The method developed here enables the dispersion integrals for an arbitrary distribution to be calculated both systematically and efficiently for either real or complex arguments.},

	abstract = {Grad's 20-moment set of transport equations has been examined in the limit of strong external magnetic fields. In this approximation, transport perpendicular to field lines is assumed to follow E×B convection paths, and the original 20-moment set of equations reduces to a set of six partial differential equations. This simplified set of equations describes the transport of mass and parallel momentum as well as the transport of parallel and perpendicular energy and heat flow in the magnetic field direction. However, since convection perpendicular to field lines is consistently carried throughout the derivation of the reduced 20-moment set, the transport of mass, momentum, energy, and heat flow perpendicular to the magnetic field is also explicitly maintained in this formulation. The effect of collisions was calculated assuming a modified relaxation model. Wave speeds and normal modes of the simplified set of equations were examined for an ion and electron gas. It was found that four of the 10 normal modes are electron thermal-heat waves which approximately decouple from the six ion waves in the system. When low-frequency waves are considered (slow-wave approximation), this allows the electron energy and heat flow equations to be solved separately from the ion equations and in a time-independent fashion. When this was done, it was found that under certain conditions these equations predict an infinite electron perpendicular temperature, Te⊥, in the collisionless regime. This occurs whenever Te⊥ is greater than the parallel temperature, Te∥ at any point along collisionless and diverging magnetic field lines. This nonphysical result calls into question the validity of generalized transport equations in the collisionless regime whenever Te⊥ is greater than Te∥. However, when applied appropriately, the significantly simplified set of equations derived here are well suited for application to a large variety of problems in planetary ionospheres and magnetospheres. We have also demonstrated that the heat flow must be limited to values smaller than the pressure times the thermal speed or otherwise the fundamental assumptions of the 20-moment truncation are violated. The double adiabatic approximation for hypersonic situations in the presence of heat flow was also examined.},

The actual physics involved changes only dispersion laws and the structure of the matrix elements. This approach makes it possible to consider a number of problems in a unique way. We discuss the stability of monochromatic waves and the statistical description of a plasma. The connection between decay and modulational instability growth rates and matrix elements is demonstrated. The standard form of the equations enables us to introduce a statistical description in a very simple way. We discuss the usual kinetic wave equations and their generalization for inhomogeneous turbulence and turbulence excited by a coherent pump.

The nonlinear evolution of these waves, in time and in two spatial dimensions, due to their coupling to other waves is studied numerically. For parameters appropriate to one-half the earth-sun distance, nonlinear effects are found to be important, as in previous one-dimensional work. However, a new and important phenomenon, two-dimensional soliton collapse, is found to occur. This collapse, induced directly by the wave-packet nature of the beam-excited waves, produces two-dimensional wave spectra extending over a much broader range of wave numbers than has been predicted by inhomogeneous quasi-linear theory. The results compare favorably with certain aspects of recent observations. The background magnetic field is neglected; while substantially justified for the present parameters, this neglect may require reexamination at locations closer to the sun.},

We compare in detail two-dimensional maps of ionospheric density, velocity, and temperatures obtained by the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association Svalbard Radar with scintillation indices detected from a network of four GNSS receivers around Svalbard and examine the different sources of free energy for irregularity creation. We observe that the strongest phase scintillations occur on the poleward side of the flow channel in a region of sheared plasma motion and structured low-energy particle precipitation. As inhomogeneous plasma flows are evident in our observations, we perform a quantitative, nonlinear analysis of the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI) and its impact on phase scintillations using numerical simulations from the first principles-based Geospace Environment Model of Ion-Neutral Interactions and Satellite-beacon Ionospheric-scintillation Global Model of the upper Atmosphere. Using representative values consistent with the radar data, we show that KHI can efficiently create density structures along with considerable scintillations and is thus likely to contribute significantly under similar conditions, which are frequent in the cusp.},

This paper demonstrates the capabilities of PFISR for producing three-dimensional volumetric images of E-region ionization patterns produced by the aurora. The phase table was configured to cycle through 121 beam positions arranged in an 11×11 grid. A 13-baud Barker coded pulse was used, which provided ∼1.5-km range resolution out to a maximum range of 250km. Backscattered power was converted to electron density by correcting for path loss and applying the Buneman approximation assuming equal electron and ion temperatures. The results were then interpolated onto a three-dimensional cartesian grid. Volumetric images are presented at 5-min, 1-min, and 14.6-s integration times (corresponding to 960, 192, and 48 pulses-per-position, respectively) to illustrate the tradeoff between spatio-temporal resolution and data quality. At 14.6s cadence, variability in plasma density within the volume appears to be fully resolved in space and time, a result that is supported by both observational evidence and theoretical predictions of ionospheric response times. Some potential applications of this mode for studying magnetosphere–ionosphere interactions in the auroral zone are discussed.},

We present a method called ELSPEC for electron spectrum estimation from incoherent scatter radar measurements, which is based on integration of the electron continuity equation and spectrum model selection by means of the Akaike information criterion. This approach allows us to use data with almost arbitrary time resolutions, enables spectrum estimation with dense energy grids, avoids noise amplifications in numerical derivatives, and yields statistical error estimates for all the output parameters, including the number and energy fluxes and upward field-aligned currents carried by the precipitating electrons. The technique is targeted for auroral energies, 1–100 keV, which ionize the atmosphere mainly between 80 and 150 km altitudes. We validate the technique by means of a simulation study, which shows that Maxwellian, kappa, and mono-energetic spectra, as well as combinations of those, can be reproduced. Comparison study for two conjugate satellite measurements to the EISCAT UHF radar are shown, for Reimei and Swarm, showing an agreement with the results. Finally, an example of a 2-hr measurement by the EISCAT radar is shown, during which we observe a variety of precipitation characteristics, from soft background precipitation to mono-energetic spectra with peak energies up to 60 keV. The upward field-aligned current varies from 0 to 10 μAm−2 and the total energy flux from 0 to 250 mWm−2.},

	abstract = {Corotating interaction regions (CIRs) are structures formed when high-speed solar wind streams overtake slow solar wind streams as they propagate outward. These structures produce regions of enhanced density and magnetic field strength in the solar wind near the ecliptic plane. In this paper, the geoeffectiveness of CIRs, as measured by the geomagnetic Dst index, is assessed during the solar wind observational period 1964–2003. A catalogue of CIRs is constructed by consulting high-speed plasma streams (HSPS) lists present in the literature and by analyzing solar wind parameters for each HSPS event. The geoeffectiveness of CIRs is analyzed by determining the number of intense (Dst ≤ −100 nT), moderate (−100 {\textless} Dst ≤ −50 nT), or weak (−50 {\textless} Dst ≤ −30 nT) magnetic storms that followed each CIR event. Statistical distributions of CIR parameters (maximum solar wind speed, maximum convection electric field, southward magnetic field peak) and geoeffectiveness (Dst peak) are obtained. Correlation analyses of Dst index with various solar wind parameters are presented. A comparison with the geoeffectiveness of other interplanetary structures such as shocks, magnetic clouds, and sector boundaries is performed. Our results show that 33\% of CIRs are followed by moderate/intense magnetic activity (Dst {\textless} −50 nT), i.e., approximately one third of the CIR events observed near Earth are geoeffective.},

In the polar regions, these sources include not only wave fluxes from the lower atmosphere and vacuum ultraviolet fluxes from the sun, but also fluxes of electromagnetic and kinetic energy of magnetospheric origin. Magnetospheric fluxes can constitute the dominant energy fluxes received by the polar atmosphere above 80km. The way that the upper atmosphere responds to these sources depends on the upper atmospheric state, the type of energy source impacting the upper atmosphere, and the source's spatial and temporal scale. Furthermore, the upper atmosphere and ionosphere are electrodynamically and intertially coupled to the magnetospheric energy sources, such that the source type, its magnitude, and its structure can be altered by the condition and response of the polar upper atmosphere. It is the intention of this paper to elaborate on this complex interplay between the magnetosphere and the polar regions, with an emphasis on the polar aeronomic behavior and its influence on the magnetospheric sources.},

With the advent of the advanced modular incoherent scatter radar RISR-N (Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radar) it is now possible for the first time to study the temporal evolution of the plasma properties in the polar cap region in three dimensions, with a spatial resolution of tens of kilometers, from which the plasma rest frame can be experimentally established. We demonstrate the strength of the diagnostic with observations from an event of enhanced plasma density observed over Resolute Bay in December 2009. A colocated all-sky imager showed faint 630.0 and 557.7 nm emission corresponding to the plasma enhancements, and the structures could be traced back to a formation region in the open/closed field line boundary. This new plasma imaging technique will provide important information on the mechanisms controlling the structuring in the high latitude ionosphere.},

We extend this method to a Generalized-Aurora Computed Tomography (G-ACT) that reconstructs the energy and spatial distributions of precipitating electrons from multi-instrument data, such as ionospheric electron density from incoherent scatter radar, cosmic noise absorption (CNA) from imaging riometers, as well as the auroral images. The purpose of this paper is to describe the reconstruction algorithm involved in this method and to test its feasibility by numerical simulation. Based on a Bayesian model with prior information as the smoothness of the electron energy spectra, the inverse problem is formulated as a maximization of posterior probability. The relative weighting of each instrument data is determined by the cross-validation method. We apply this method to the simulated data from real instruments, the Auroral Large Imaging System (ALIS), the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar at Tromsø, and the Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Study (IRIS) at Kilpisjärvi. The results indicate that the differential flux of the precipitating electrons is well reconstructed from the ALIS images for the low-noise cases. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a case study that the ionospheric electron density from the EISCAT radar is useful for improving the reconstructed electron flux. On the other hand, the incorporation of CNA data into this method is difficult at this stage, because the extension of energy range to higher energy causes a difficulty in the reconstruction of the low-energy electron flux. Nevertheless, we expect that this method may be useful in analyzing multi-instrument data and, in particular, 3-D data, which will be obtained in the upcoming EISCAT\_3D.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Space plasmas are host to the electrostatic Langmuir waves and a rich range of processes associated with them. Many of such processes that are of interest in micro-scale plasma physics and magnetosphere-ionosphere physics are open to investigation via incoherent scatter plasma lines—i.e., a pair of resonant peaks in the incoherent scatter radar (ISR) spectrum, symmetrically displaced from the radar transmitting frequency by about the plasma frequency, as the signature of Langmuir waves in the ISR spectrum. There now exists a large body of literature devoted to the investigation of a number of topics in ionospheric physics via plasma line theory and observation. It is the goal of this work to provide a comprehensive review of this literature, from the early theoretical works on oscillations in magnetized plasma to the recent advances in plasma line measurements and applications. This review includes detailed theoretical discussions on the intensity and frequency displacement of plasma lines. It reviews the experimental observations of plasma lines enhanced by various sources of energy and discusses the implications of the observations in the context of ionospheric physics. The review also covers the practical aspects of plasma line measurements, from measurement techniques to the applications of plasma lines in estimating the bulk parameters of the ionosphere.},

The energy spectrum and resultant emission rates are estimated for a 10 s period when the arc was in the field of view of the optical instrumentation. Modeled images of the observed aurora are produced using the estimated emission rates and compared with the optical observations of the aurora. We find the modeled images reproduce the structure and dynamics of the observed aurora to within the uncertainties of the models used.

	abstract = {An array of sensitive electrostatic analyzers was borne on the earth satellite Injun 5 in a nearly polar low-altitude orbit. The energy spectrums and angular distributions of proton and electron intensities over the energy range 5≲E≲50,000 ev were measured separately and simultaneously with good temporal and energy resolutions over the auroral zones and polar cap regions and within the outer radiation zone. Fully color-coded energy-time (E-t) spectrograms are utilized to present and effectively digest a massive body of individual intensity measurements. Several of the principal observational results were: (1) In the late evening sector the electron precipitation patterns are usually characterized by two or more bands of low-energy electron precipitation during periods of relative magnetic quiescence, Kp≃0 to 2. (2) With increasing magnetic activity, Kp≃3 to 4+, these ‘bands’ of precipitated electron intensities become more intense, and often less well defined, relative to those observed during quiescent periods. (3) During these periods of relative magnetic disturbance, a persistent inverted ‘V’ substructure in the E-t spectrograms is evident. This substructure displays a well-defined increase of the electron energy for peak differential intensities with time to a maximum energy usually ∼kiloelectron volts followed by a subsequent decrease of this energy. (4) Occasionally a relatively structureless, broad precipitation pattern is observed at late local evening during magnetically disturbed periods. (5) In the late local evening sector the dominant band of proton precipitation is often located just inside, i.e., equatorward of, the termination of low-energy electron precipitation. (6) Energy influxes into the earth's upper atmosphere during late evening have been observed to be as low as ≲1 erg (cm2 sec)−1 during magnetic quiescence and as high as ≃250 ergs (cm2 sec)−1 for disturbed periods. (7) The over-all features of electron precipitation in the late-morning sector are generally more diffuse and less intense relative to those observed during local evening. (8) The late-morning precipitation patterns are often characterized by a subtructure, not spanning the width of the entire precipitation region, that displays decreasing average electron energies with increasing invariant latitudes. (9) The electron precipitation in the late morning sector is often bounded at its high-latitude edge by a remarkably intense, narrow band of low-energy electron intensities. Typical widths of this intense, unique structure are ∼20 to 30 km. The electron spectrums and densities are similar to those observed in the distant magnetosheath. These observations are discussed in terms of previous results gained with similar instrumentation at great distances within the earth's magnetosphere near the magnetic equator and the implications concerning the source regions and mechanisms for the auroral plasmas.},

	abstract = {A technique is presented for inverting incoherent scatter radar (ISR) measurements of the auroral ionosphere to determine the incident electron energy spectrum. A linear model is constructed relating electron differential number flux to the volume production rate of ions, the latter derived from measured electron density profiles using a continuity equation. The forward model is inverted using the maximum entropy method (MEM). This implementation of ISR inversion was found to be remarkably robust to the principal sources of model and measurement uncertainty. The procedure was applied to high-resolution measurements (1.2 s × 1 km) by the Sondrestrom ISR recorded during an auroral surge. Analysis of bulk plasma properties in the recovered spectra suggested that the relationship between the characteristic energy and the net number flux was highly nonlinear during the onset of the auroral surge, an observation that can now be evaluated statistically. This perspective on the temporal behavior of the auroral acceleration region cannot be accessed through spaceborne measurements; ISR inversion thus constitutes a critical tool for addressing time-dependent coupling of the magnetosphere and ionosphere.},

The energy and flux of the precipitating electrons, volume emission rates and local electric fields in the ionosphere have been determined at high temporal (up to 30 Hz) and spatial (down to tens of metres) resolution. A new time-dependent inversion model is used to derive energy spectra from EISCAT electron density profiles. The energy and flux are also derived independently from optical emissions combined with ion-chemistry modelling, and a good agreement is found. A robust method to obtain detailed 2-D maps of the average energy and number flux of small scale aurora is presented. The arcs are stretched in the north-south direction, and the lowest energies are found on the western, leading edges of the arcs. The large ionospheric electric fields (250 mV m$^{\textrm{−1}}$) found from tristatic radar measurements are evidence of strong currents associated with the region close to the optical arcs. The different data sets indicate that the arcs appear on the boundaries between regions with different average energy of diffuse precipitation, caused by pitch-angle scattering. The two thin arcs on these boundaries are found to be related to an increase in number flux (and thus increased energy flux) without an increase in energy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This study investigates the feasibility of estimating the three-dimensional electric field and neutral wind vectors along a magnetic field-aligned profile from E3D measurements, using the ion momentum equation and Maxwell's equations. The uncertainty of ion drift measurements is estimated for a time and height resolution of 5 s and 2 km. With the most favourable ionospheric conditions, the ion wind at E region peak can be measured with an accuracy of less than 1 m/s. In the worst case, during a geomagnetically quiet night, the uncertainty increases by a factor of around 10. The uncertainty of neutral wind and electric field estimates is found to be strongly dependent on the prior constraints imposed on them. In the lower E region, neutral wind estimates have a lower standard deviation than 10 m/s in the most favourable conditions. In such conditions, also the F region electric field can be estimated with uncertainty of about 1 mV/m. Simulated measurements of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}{\textless}em{\textgreater}v{\textless}/em{\textgreater}{\textless}/strong{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} are used to demonstrate the ability to resolve the field-aligned profile of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}{\textless}em{\textgreater}E{\textless}/em{\textgreater}{\textless}/strong{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}{\textless}em{\textgreater}u{\textless}/em{\textgreater}{\textless}/strong{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}.

The frequency spectrum, as well as the amplitude, of the scattered radiation is calculated. Particular attention is paid to the part of the spectrum which corresponds to small Doppler shifts, this being the region of greatest significance in connexion with the phenomenon of incoherent scattering from the ionosphere. The calculations are based on a generalized version of Nyquist’s noise theorem, and they lead to the following conclusions: (1) The mean scattering cross-section for the ionosphere is equal to that which would exist if each of the electrons scattered independently with a cross-section of one-half the classical Thomson cross-section. (2) The mean Doppler broadening of the scattered signal corresponds roughly to the speed of the ions rather than to that of the electrons. (3) The spectral shape of this signal is not Gaussian. There is a mild maximum in the spectrum away from the central frequency, as can be seen in figure 1. (4) Plasma resonance effects contribute only negligibly to the scattering for frequencies currently of interest.},

	abstract = {The theory of incoherent scattering in a plasma is extended to include the effect of ions and electrons colliding with neutral molecules, an effect that could be important in the ionosphere below perhaps 150 km for experiments at frequencies of the order of 50 Mc/s or less. We find, first of all, that the total scattered power is completely independent of collisions; the collisions only affect the shape of the spectrum. If, as is usually the case, the Debye length [6.9 (T/N)1/2 cm] is small compared to λ/4π. (λ is the radio wavelength), the spectrum begins to become narrower and peaked at the center when the mean free path of the ions becomes comparable to λ/4π. Any possible ion gyroresonant effects on the spectrum due to the presence of a magnetic field will be prevented if the collision frequency of the ions is greater than or equal to their gyrofrequency. If the Debye length should happen to be greater than λ/4π, the above comments would apply to the mean free path, collision frequency, and gyrofrequency of the electrons; however, such electron effects are not likely to be important in the ionosphere. It does seem that perhaps we might be able to measure ion collision rates by means of incoherent scattering. The principal difficulty would be in obtaining, from low altitudes, incoherent scattering signals uncontaminated by other types of scattering.},

Many of the weaker features of the echoes from the electrojet irregularities cannot be explained on this basis, however. The waves generated by the instability will grow in amplitude until they are limited by nonlinear effects. These effects, furthermore, will cause coupling between waves that will generate new waves that cannot be directly excited. In the present paper we show that scattering from such secondary irregularities can account for many of the weak features of the VHF echoes. The theory is only qualitative, but the agreement between its predictions and most of the experimental observations is quite good.},

Two approximate formulas for the total scattered power are derived, which, with certain restrictions, are applicable (1) when Te/Ti ≲ 1, (2) when Te/Ti » 1. For moderately large values of the temperature ratio, a full numerical calculation is necessary. In contrast to the equilibrium case, the total scattered power is not independent of the magnetic field when Te/Ti is not unity. In the interesting case in which the ion cyclotron radius is large compared to wavelengths of interest, but the electron cyclotron radius is small, the mass ratio me/mi is replaced by an effective ratio (me/mi) sec2 α, where α is the angle between the propagation vector k and the magnetic field. As α approaches 90°, the effective mass ratio ceases to be small, and the scattering is significantly altered. The general behavior of the scattering has a simple physical explanation. The scattering can be considered to be from acoustic waves that are in equilibrium with the particles that contribute most to their Landau damping.},

However, it can also be used successfully to calculate fluctuating quantities in systems in quasi-equilibrium, a familiar example being a circuit with elements at different temperatures. An analogous calculation can be carried out for a plasma, considering each particle species as a separate element of the system. One calculates the spontaneous force generated by each species (with its own temperature and mean drift velocity) and also a set of transfer functions which relate each of these forces to the electron perturbations which are responsible for the scattering. The important point to realize in the plasma case is that, with this approach, the electric field perturbations, which couple the species together, enter the calculation only through the transfer function and are not involved in the statistics of the ‘generalized forces.’ The results obtained apply for multiple ion species with unequal temperatures, unequal mean drift velocities, unequal charges (including negative), etc., and agree with similar calculations based on the dressed particle approach.},

	abstract = {Measurements of plasma lines by the Arecibo incoherent scatter radar are known to have sharp striations in power, varying with the plasma frequency and magnetic aspect angle of the radar beam. We explain these power striations as the manifestation of a suprathermal electron population with peaks in energy at approximately 15, 25, and 45 eV. These energies correspond to sharp features in the photoelectron energy spectra measured by rockets and spacecraft. A new theory is developed to predict the plasma line power for an arbitrary, magnetized suprathermal distribution. The magnetization terms in this theory are shown to contribute substantially to the enhancement of plasma line power through inverse Landau and cyclotron damping of the suprathermal peaks. The theory is applied as a forward model to measurements obtained at Arecibo for different magnetic field aspect angles, showing general agreement with the data. At large magnetic aspect angles the theory reproduces the upper-hybrid instability which can cause 150 km echoes. The developed theory allows for the suprathermal distribution at a given altitude to be probed across a wide range of energies and pitch angles.},

	abstract = {This study presents an improved method to estimate differential energy flux, auroral power and field-aligned current of electron precipitation from incoherent scatter radar data. The method is based on a newly developed data analysis technique that uses Bayesian filtering to fit altitude profiles of electron density, electron temperature, and ion temperature to observed incoherent scatter spectra with high time and range resolutions. The electron energy spectra are inverted from the electron density profiles. Previous high-time resolution fits have relied on the raw electron density, which is calculated from the backscattered power assuming that the ion and electron temperatures are equal. The improved technique is applied to one auroral event measured by the EISCAT UHF radar and it is demonstrated that the effect of electron heating on electron energy spectra, auroral power, and upward field-aligned current can be significant at times. Using the fitted electron densities instead of the raw ones may lead to wider electron energy spectra and auroral power up to 75\% larger. The largest differences take place for precipitation that produces enhanced electron heating in the upper E region, and in this study correspond to fluxes of electrons with peak energies from 3 to 5 keV. Finally, the auroral power estimates are verified by comparison to the 427.8 nm auroral emission intensity, which shows good correlation. The improved method makes it possible to calculate unbiased estimates of electron energy spectra with high time resolution and thereby to study rapidly varying aurora.},

	abstract = {In 2008, coordinated radar-optical auroral observations were organized in Northern Scandinavia using the European Incoherent Scatter Radar (EISCAT) and the Auroral Large Imaging System (ALIS). A bright auroral arc was imaged on 5 March 2008 from four ground-based stations, remaining stable between 18:41 and 18:44 UT and coinciding with increased electron densities. This work presents a unified inversion framework deriving the electron energy spectrum from either optical ( 1NG(0,1) emission at 4278 Å) or radar (electron density) observations. An updated forward model of the ionosphere based on a 1-D kinetic Monte Carlo model is described, characterizing the linear system to invert. The 3-D blue volume emission rate is first estimated with an iterative reconstruction technique. Also presented is a novel way to calculate an accurate initial guess for auroral tomography taking into account the horizontal/vertical nonuniformity of the emission region. This technique supersedes the often-used Chapman profile as initial guess when high spatial resolution is needed. The second step, performed for the first time with ALIS optical observations, uses the forward model to retrieve from the emission rates the 2-D latitude/longitude map of the electron energy spectrum. The same model and inversion methods are finally applied to the EISCAT electron density profiles to derive the temporal energy spectrum of precipitating electrons along the magnetic zenith. Energy spectra from radar and optics are in good agreement. Results suggest that the arc is generated by a complex energy spectrum reminiscent of dispersive Alfvén waves with two main peaks (2.5, 6 keV) and a typical latitudinal width of 7.5 km.},

In this way, the inversion is automatically restricted to physical emission rate profiles. We show the effectiveness of the method in the all-sky camera case by simulated examples. The method is also applied to real data. The method is capable of correctly reconstructing not only auroral arc positions but also the precipitating electron energy and number fluxes, although not necessarily the full differential flux. A natural limitation is that arcs that are significantly off-zenith and are viewed sideways by only one all-sky camera station are smeared out.

We propose a new incoherent scatter analysis technique that uses data from all receiver beams of a multistatic, multibeam radar system and produces, in addition to the plasma parameters typically measured with monostatic radars, estimates of ion velocity vectors and ion temperature anisotropies. Because the total scattered energy collected with remote receivers of a modern multistatic, multibeam radar system may even exceed the energy collected with the core transmit-and-receive site, the remote data improve the accuracy of all plasma parameter estimates, including those that could be measured with the core site alone. We apply the new multistatic analysis method for data measured by the tristatic European Incoherent Scatter VHF radar and the Kilpisjärvi Atmospheric Imaging Receiver Array (KAIRA) multibeam receiver and show that a significant improvement in accuracy is obtained by adding KAIRA data in the multistatic analysis.

This technique, which has earlier mostly been used to measure high-resolution E-region ion-line spectra, turned out to be a very good alternative to other techniques for plasma-line measurements. The experiment provides simultaneous measurement of the ion line and downshifted and upshifted plasma-line spectra with an altitude resolution of 3 km and a temporal resolution of 10 s. The measurements are taken around the peak of the F region, but not necessarily at the peak itself, as is the case with the long-pulse technique. The condition for success is that the scale height should be large enough such that the backscattered signal from the range extent of one gate falls inside the receiver filter. The data are analysed and the results are combined with the results of the ion-line data analysis to estimate electron mean drift velocity and thereafter electric currents along the line of sight of the radar using both the standard dispersion relation assuming a Maxwellian electron velocity distribution and the more recent model including a heat-flow correction term.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The EISCAT (European Incoherent SCATer) Scientific Association has provided versatile incoherent scatter (IS) radar facilities on the mainland of northern Scandinavia (the EISCAT UHF and VHF radar systems) and on Svalbard (the electronically scanning radar ESR (EISCAT Svalbard Radar) for studies of the high-latitude ionised upper atmosphere (the ionosphere). The mainland radars were constructed about 30 years ago, based on technological solutions of that time. The science drivers of today, however, require a more flexible instrument, which allows measurements to be made from the troposphere to the topside ionosphere and gives the measured parameters in three dimensions, not just along a single radar beam. The possibility for continuous operation is also an essential feature. To facilitatefuture science work with a world-leading IS radar facility, planning of a new radar system started first with an EU-funded Design Study (2005–2009) and has continued with a follow-up EU FP7 EISCAT\_3D Preparatory Phase project (2010–2014). The radar facility will be realised by using phased arrays, and a key aspect is the use of advanced software and data processing techniques. This type of software radar will act as a pathfinder for other facilities worldwide. The new radar facility will enable the EISCAT\_3D science community to address new, significant science questions as well as to serve society, which is increasingly dependent on space-based technology and issues related to space weather. The location of the radar within the auroral oval and at the edge of the stratospheric polar vortex is also ideal for studies of the long-term variability in the atmosphere and global change. This paper is a summary of the EISCAT\_3D science case, which was prepared as part of the EU-funded Preparatory Phase project for the new facility. Three science working groups, drawn from the EISCAT user community, participated in preparing this document. In addition to these working group members, who are listed as authors, thanks are due to many others in the EISCAT scientific community for useful contributions, discussions, and support.},

When detectable the plasma line gives accurate measure of the electron density and can potentially be used to constrain incoherent scatter estimates of electron temperature. We investigate the statistical occurrence of plasma line enhancements with data from the high-latitude EISCAT Svalbard Radar obtained during the International Polar Year (IPY, 2007–2008). A computationally fast method was implemented to recover the range-frequency dependence of the plasma line. Plasma line backscatter strength strongly depends on time of day, season, altitude, and geomagnetic activity, and the backscatter is detectable in 22.6 \% of the total measurements during the IPY. As expected, maximum detection is achieved when photo-electrons due to the Sun's EUV radiation are present. During summer daytime hours the occurrence of detectable plasma lines at altitudes below the F-region peak is up to 90 \%. During wintertime the occurrence is a few percent. Electron density profiles recovered from the plasma line show great detail of density variations in height and time. For example, effects of inertial gravity waves on the electron density are observed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Without previous need to interpolate over source energy and atmospheric range, the new parameterization provides an easier implementation with a robust fit of model calculations for a wide range of incident energies and atmospheric conditions. By decomposing any incident energy spectrum into contiguous monoenergetic components and then calculating and integrating their resulting ionization, our parameterization is a valuable tool that can be used in conjunction with global models to accurately quantify the impact from realistic precipitating electrons during space weather events.},

This study carries out a thorough testing of the method and a few improvements for its emission physics equations. {\textless}P style="line-height: 20px;"{\textgreater} We compared the precipitating electron energy fluxes as estimated by the inversion method to the energy flux data recorded by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites during four passes over auroral structures. When the aurorae appear very close to the local zenith, the fluxes inverted from the blue (427.8nm) filtered ASC images or blue and green line (557.7nm) images together give the best agreement with the measured flux values. The fluxes inverted from green line images alone are clearly larger than the measured ones. Closer to the horizon the quality of the inversion results from blue images deteriorate to the level of the ones from green images. In addition to the satellite data, the precipitating electron energy fluxes were estimated from the electron density measurements by the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR). These energy flux values were compared to the ones of the inversion method applied to over 100 ASC images recorded at the nearby ASC station in Longyearbyen. The energy fluxes deduced from these two types of data are in general of the same order of magnitude. In 35\% of all of the blue and green image inversions the relative errors were less than 50\% and in 90\% of the blue and green image inversions less than 100\%. {\textless}P style="line-height: 20px;"{\textgreater} This kind of systematic testing of the inversion method is the first step toward using all-sky camera images in the way in which global UV images have recently been used to estimate the energy fluxes.

It will be mounted on the despun platform of the POLAR spacecraft and will measure the spatial distribution and temporal variation of auroral X-ray emissions in the 2 to 60 keV energy range on the day side of the Earth as well as the night. PIXIE consists of two pinhole cameras integrated into one assembly, each equipped with an adjustable aperture plate that allows an optimum number of nonoverlapping images to be formed in the detector plane at each phase of the satellite's eccentric orbit. The aperture plates also allow the pinhole size to be adjusted so that the experimenter can trade off spatial resolution against instrument sensitivity. In the principal mode of operation, one aperture plate will be positioned for high spatial resolution and the other for high sensitivity. The detectors consist of four stacked multiwire position-sensitive proportional counters, two in each of two separate gas chambers. The front chamber operates in the 2–12 keV energy range and the rear chamber in the 10–60 keV range. All of the energy and position information for each telemetered X-ray event is available on the ground. This enables the experimenter to adjust the exposure timepostfacto so that energy spectra of each X-ray emitting region can be independently accumulated. From these data PIXIE will provide, for the first time, global images of precipitated energetic electron spectra, energy inputs, ionospheric electron densities, and upper atmospheric conductivities.},

Calculated column emission rates for these features as well as those of narrow O I 8446 Å and broad O I 8446 Å are presented as functions of the hardness of the incident electron spectrum and the concentrations of O and O2. Selected ratios of these rates such as narrow/broad (for 7774 Å) and red/blue are also presented. Incident spectra are characterized by Maxwellian energy distributions with characteristic energies ranging from 0.1 to 8 keV. Composition is modeled using a Jacchia (1977) model where scaling factors are applied to the O and O2 number densities. Scaling factors for O range from 0.1 to 1, and factors of 1 and 1.5 are considered for O2. As a group, the above rates and ratios show considerable variation over the just described parameter ranges, making them attractive for monitoring incident electron energy flux, its mean energy, and the concentrations of O and O2 relative to N2. The red line is a key feature of the above group which is sensitive to the low-energy portion (subkilovolt) of the incident electron spectrum. Since this can vary considerably from one aurora to another having the same approximate mean energy, it becomes an added parameter to be considered within any algorithm using the red line. Paper 2 (Meier et al., this issue) discusses this problem as part of a detailed investigation of the red line. In the current paper, one particular representation of a low-energy component is considered for making the red line calculations. A final subject of this paper is the use of temperatures deduced from measurements of rotational line distributions and atomic line Doppler widths to infer mean energies of precipitating electrons. Calculated effective temperatures versus hardness of the incident electron spectrum are presented and discussed in the context of more precise techniques for relating measurements of rotational line distributions and Doppler widths to electron spectral hardness.},

The incomplete data problem for three-dimensional computerized tomography, due to the very limited angular range and the small number of observers, is solved by an iterative least squares method. A theoretical example with the projection of two auroral arcs can be reconstructed with projection root-mean-square errors of the order of 1\%. Application of noise deteriorates the quality of reconstruction, but with suitable low-pass filtering, root-mean-square errors of less than 5\% can be obtained. The agreement between observed and calculated projections, as well as between the original and the reconstructed volume emission distribution, is quantitatively discussed for different observation geometries. With only two observation sites the range of acceptable observation geometries is limited to distances of 25 to 50 km between the observers but depends on the actual location and the morphology of the aurora. Sources of distortion of real auroral observations with intensified CCD cameras are discussed and correction procedures proposed. The complete procedure is applied to a real stereoscopic auroral observation. The correspondence of original pictures and projections of the reconstructed volume is discussed, and emission profiles along magnetic field lines are extracted from the three-dimensionally reconstructed arc.},

Basic information from many disciplines such as radiation physics and chemistry, fluid dynamics, optics, and spectroscopy is skilfully marshalled to give a coherent account of the upper atmosphere.

	abstract = {We present a new parameterization of the altitude profile of the ionization rate in the Earth's atmosphere due to precipitating energetic electrons. Precipitating electrons are assumed to have a Maxwellian energy distribution and an isotropic pitch angle distribution above the atmosphere. In this study, two electron transport models (whose validity has been verified by observations) are employed to calculate the ionization rate, to which we have fit our new parameterization. To derive a new parameterization, we follow a similar scheme to that of Roble and Ridley (1987) but take into account further functional dependence on the incident electron energy. As a result, the new method presented in this paper provides a highly improved prediction for electron impact in a significantly extended energy range from 100 eV to 1 MeV, spanning 4 orders of magnitude. Note that we have neglected the contribution of bremsstrahlung X rays generated by energetic electrons, which are mostly important below 50 km altitude. The comparison of parameterization results with model calculations shows that the errors generally fall well within ±5\% in both the altitude-integrated total ionization rate and the peak value. The altitude profile as a whole is also accurately predicted, with errors in the altitudes of the peak and e-folding ionization rates significantly less than 5 km. The proposed new parameterization method with high accuracy is thus ready to be implemented into global models to assess the electron impact on the ionosphere and the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {This study presents an improved method to estimate differential energy flux, auroral power and field-aligned current of electron precipitation from incoherent scatter radar data. The method is based on a newly developed data analysis technique that uses Bayesian filtering to fit altitude profiles of electron density, electron temperature, and ion temperature to observed incoherent scatter spectra with high time and range resolutions. The electron energy spectra are inverted from the electron density profiles. Previous high-time resolution fits have relied on the raw electron density, which is calculated from the backscattered power assuming that the ion and electron temperatures are equal. The improved technique is applied to one auroral event measured by the EISCAT UHF radar and it is demonstrated that the effect of electron heating on electron energy spectra, auroral power, and upward field-aligned current can be significant at times. Using the fitted electron densities instead of the raw ones may lead to wider electron energy spectra and auroral power up to 75\% larger. The largest differences take place for precipitation that produces enhanced electron heating in the upper E region, and in this study correspond to fluxes of electrons with peak energies from 3 to 5 keV. Finally, the auroral power estimates are verified by comparison to the 427.8 nm auroral emission intensity, which shows good correlation. The improved method makes it possible to calculate unbiased estimates of electron energy spectra with high time resolution and thereby to study rapidly varying aurora.},

The spectral distribution of the spatial Fourier components of these fluctuations is derived from basic principles. The fluctuations in electron density are discussed in some detail, and spectra are computed under conditions that are thought to prevail in the outer ionosphere. Frequency spectra of general validity are computed for electron-density fluctuations along the magnetic field. It is shown by means of examples that the frequency spectra under ionospheric conditions are little influenced by the magnetic field except for density fluctuations fairly close to perpendicularity to the magnetic field. Applications to incoherent backscattering are discussed, and it is shown that, under suitable conditions, backscatter techniques can give valuable information about electron density, temperature, and constituents of the ionosphere.},

This is important when matching to the time scales of auroral precipitation-related phenomena, such as energy input into the atmosphere and magnetospheric electron acceleration mechanisms. We describe the measurement technique and show an example observation of auroral precipitation. The results show transients in electron density in the order of a few seconds, which are fully resolved by the plasma line measurements. An electron precipitation model is used to estimate precipitation energy and flux density. The energetic electron flux during the example event has variations even at short time scales. The results show that electron density profiles derived from plasma lines can be a powerful new observational capability.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional Monte Carlo model has been developed to study the transverse beam spreading effect of incident energetic auroral protons during their precipitation in the Earth's upper atmosphere. Energetic protons with an isotropic angular distribution are injected at 700 km altitude. Two types of incident energy spectra, a monoenergetic and a Maxwellian distribution, are considered. Interaction of fast particles with a three-species atmosphere (O, N2, and O2) is included through charge exchange, electron stripping, ionization, excitation, and elastic scattering collisions. A uniform geomagnetic field is assumed in the model. The spreading effect is simulated for both a fine proton beam and a proton arc of longitudinal and latitudinal extent. It is found that the main dispersion region for a fine proton beam is located in the altitude range of around 250–450 km, where the first few charge exchange collisions play a significant role. In the spreading study for a proton arc, we compare the numerical results with previous studies and give a convincing explanation by analyzing atmospheric scale heights and cross-section data. For the purpose of the model validity check, we make a comparison of the Monte Carlo simulation with observations and the results from other models.},

	abstract = {The Chatanika radar has been used to measure the ratio of atomic (O+) ions to molecular (O2+, NO+) ions in the high-latitude ionosphere. The radar results agreed well with simultaneous in situ rocket data, giving confidence in the radar method of deducing ion composition. Measurements made over long periods of time show seasonal variations, diurnal variations, and variations due to auroral processes. The transition altitude, where the number densities of atomic and molecular ions are equal, is a convenient parameter for describing the composition variation with altitude or ‘composition altitude profile.’ The transition altitude occurs at ∼190 km at night and ∼170 km during the day, in agreement with midlatitude results. During the winter the daytime transition altitude is 15 km lower than in summer, a seasonal variation similar to that at midlatitudes. Energetic particle precipitation results in the lowering of the transition altitude, by 10 km in one case when energetic particles deposited ∼20 ergs/cm² s in the atmosphere. The largest variations in ion composition were found during periods of large joule heat input resulting from electric fields on the order of 50 mV/m. The transition altitude increased by 50 km in a case where the joule heat input rate was 30 ergs/cm² s. These observations were compared to calculations from a simple steady state model involving the principal consituents and reactions. The results indicate that the transition altitude during particle precipitation is most influenced by the increased ion production. There do not appear to be significant effects from possible increases of N2 vibrational temperature. A number of interrelated effects contribute to the increase in transition altitude during joule heating. The most important effect is the electric field contribution in raising the effective ion temperature. In addition, it appears that increased N2 density is also required to account for the observed change.},

	abstract = {Ion densities and composition are investigated in a time varying model aurora. There is a time lag between turning on the source of ionization and the resulting increase in ion densities that depends on the species and the height level in the ionsophere, so that altitude profiles of auroral electron densities evolve with time. Characteristic buildup times for the ionization are a few seconds at the altitude of maximum energy deposition, increasing to tens of seconds above and below this level. A wide range of composition ratios, n(NO+/n(O2+ and n(NO+/n(O+), can be expected, depending on the time an observation is made during buildup or decay of ionization. The concentrations of atomic nitrogen and nitric oxide increase as a result of auroral ionization, but the associated characteristic times are long compared to the average duration of ‘auroral event’. Thus, intermittent auroral bombardment could result in a gradual buildup of these minor neutral constituents in the auroral atmosphere. Variations in the electron density during pulsating, fluctuating or coruscating aurora lag the source function variations by a few seconds in a typical aurora.},

The European Incoherent Scatter UHF radar was directed in magnetic zenith on 9–11 March 2016 while stepping the pump frequency across the double resonance of the fourth harmonic of the electron gyrofrequency and the local upper hybrid frequency, in a 3-min-on, 3-min-off pump cycle. Topside and bottomside enhancements occur at the respective plasma resonance altitude and seem to be asymmetrically conditioned by the relative proximity of the pump frequency to the double resonance frequency. Further, the topside HF-induced ion line enhancements predominantly appear while the pump frequency is just below the double resonance frequency and only simultaneous to strong bottomside enhancements. A powerful, HF radio wave in O-mode, transmitted in the direction of magnetic zenith is reflected a few kilometers below the plasma resonance altitude, where the pump frequency is equal to the local plasma frequency, on the bottomside F-region in the ionosphere. Transionospheric propagation of the pump wave outside the radio window can be facilitated by density striations in the plasma, and we consider, in detail, the possible mechanisms proposed for propagation outside the standard radio window.},

In the ensuing decades new observations, including radar and low-altitude spacecraft, MHD simulations, and theoretical considerations have tremendously advanced our understanding of this system. The AMPTE/IRM, THEMIS and Cluster missions have added considerable observational knowledge, especially on the important role of fast flows in producing the stresses that generate the substorm current wedge. Recent detailed, multi-spacecraft, multi-instrument observations both in the magnetosphere and in the ionosphere have brought a wealth of new information about the details of the temporal evolution and structure of the current system. While the large-scale picture remains valid, the new details call for revision and an update of the original view. In this paper we briefly review the historical development of the substorm current wedge, review recent in situ and ground-based observations and theoretical work, and discuss the current active research areas. We conclude with a revised, time-dependent picture of the substorm current wedge that follows its evolution from the initial substorm flows through substorm expansion and recovery.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional Monte Carlo model has been developed to study the transverse beam spreading effect of incident energetic auroral protons during their precipitation in the Earth's upper atmosphere. Energetic protons with an isotropic angular distribution are injected at 700 km altitude. Two types of incident energy spectra, a monoenergetic and a Maxwellian distribution, are considered. Interaction of fast particles with a three-species atmosphere (O, N2, and O2) is included through charge exchange, electron stripping, ionization, excitation, and elastic scattering collisions. A uniform geomagnetic field is assumed in the model. The spreading effect is simulated for both a fine proton beam and a proton arc of longitudinal and latitudinal extent. It is found that the main dispersion region for a fine proton beam is located in the altitude range of around 250–450 km, where the first few charge exchange collisions play a significant role. In the spreading study for a proton arc, we compare the numerical results with previous studies and give a convincing explanation by analyzing atmospheric scale heights and cross-section data. For the purpose of the model validity check, we make a comparison of the Monte Carlo simulation with observations and the results from other models.},

Flickering aurora is caused by electron precipitation with modulations at frequencies higher than 5 Hz. To resolve the variation at these short time-scales with ISR we have integrated together pulses at the same phase of the optical intensity variation observed with high-speed narrow field-of-view imaging in white light to determine the intensity variation in the field aligned direction, which is also the direction of the beam of the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR). Further we show that the 3\% modulation in ISR back-scattered power can be explained with electron heating by temporally modulated electron precipitation and electron cooling in collisions with ions and neutrals.},

	abstract = {The work presents a data-model synthesis examining the response of the auroral F-region ion temperature, composition, and density to short time scale (\&lt;1 min) electric field disturbances associated with auroral arcs. Ion temperature profiles recorded by the Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar (ISR) are critically analyzed with the aid of theoretical calculations to infer ion composition variability. The analyses presented include a partial accounting for the effects of neutral winds on frictional heating and show promise as the groundwork for future attempts to address ion temperature-mass ambiguities in short-integration ISR data sets. Results indicate that large NO+ enchancements in the F-region can occur in as little as 20 s in response to impulsive changes in ion frictional heating. Enhancements in molecular ion density result in recombination and a depletion in plasma, which is shown to occur on time scales of several minutes. This depletion process, thus, appears to be of comparable importance to electrodynamic evacuation processes in producing auroral arc-related plasma depletions. Furthermore, the potential of ionospheric composition in regulating the amounts and types of ions supplied to the magnetosphere is outlined.},

	abstract = {It has been previously demonstrated that a two-ion (O+ and H+) 8-moment time-dependent fluid model was able to reproduce correctly the ionospheric structure in the altitude range probed by the EISCAT-VHF radar. In the present study, the model is extended down to the E-region where molecular ion chemistry (NO+ and O+2, essentially) prevails over transport; EISCAT-UHF observations confirmed previous theoretical predictions that during events of intense E×B induced convection drifts, molecular ions (mainly NO+) predominate over O+ ions up to altitudes of 300 km. In addition to this extension of the model down to the E-region, the ionization and heating resulting from both solar insolation and particle precipitation is now taken into account in a consistent manner through a complete kinetic transport code. The effects of E×B induced convection drifts on the E- and F-region are presented: the balance between O+ and NO+ ions is drastically affected; the electric field acts to deplete the O+ ion concentration. The [NO+]/[O+] transition altitude varies from 190 km to 320 km as the perpendicular electric field increases from 0 to 100 mV m-1. An interesting additional by-product of the model is that it also predicts the presence of a noticeable fraction of N+ ions in the topside ionosphere in good agreement with Retarding Ion Mass Spectrometer measurements onboard Dynamic Explorer.},

	abstract = {This study presents an improved method to estimate differential energy flux, auroral power and field-aligned current of electron precipitation from incoherent scatter radar data. The method is based on a newly developed data analysis technique that uses Bayesian filtering to fit altitude profiles of electron density, electron temperature, and ion temperature to observed incoherent scatter spectra with high time and range resolutions. The electron energy spectra are inverted from the electron density profiles. Previous high-time resolution fits have relied on the raw electron density, which is calculated from the backscattered power assuming that the ion and electron temperatures are equal. The improved technique is applied to one auroral event measured by the EISCAT UHF radar and it is demonstrated that the effect of electron heating on electron energy spectra, auroral power, and upward field-aligned current can be significant at times. Using the fitted electron densities instead of the raw ones may lead to wider electron energy spectra and auroral power up to 75\% larger. The largest differences take place for precipitation that produces enhanced electron heating in the upper E region, and in this study correspond to fluxes of electrons with peak energies from 3 to 5 keV. Finally, the auroral power estimates are verified by comparison to the 427.8 nm auroral emission intensity, which shows good correlation. The improved method makes it possible to calculate unbiased estimates of electron energy spectra with high time resolution and thereby to study rapidly varying aurora.},
